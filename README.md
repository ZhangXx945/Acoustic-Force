# Acoustic-Force
Simulation on acoustic force by julia language
BetaV2 was reconstructed from the BetaV1 and some bugs have been fixed. The .jl files can be directly included in julia program, and both the .pdf and the .txt files are the source codes. 
the parallel computation is applied in the acoustic force part of version BetaV2.1.
BetaV3 was reconstructed from BetaV2, add a function keeping the symmetry when executing the molecule dynamics
